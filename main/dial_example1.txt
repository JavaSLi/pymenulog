Menu-example
HELP
  Menudialog consists of three parts, Menu-Area, Log-Area, and Dial-Area,
    plus a command input-box.
  Menu-Area has many lines of commands and comments.
  Menu lines are often indented to show tree-structure
  The command lines often use the format of 'command+/+/+comment',
    and only comment part is shown in the Menu List
  Log-Area lines are output from the running command,
    and the new lines are often generated so quickly
    that you can only glance over them rather than check them.
  To check the detail of the Log,
    you can double-click on Log-list,
    then a sub-window with a paused log-list will popup.
  To double-click on the paused log-list,
    the popup sub-window will be closed,
    and the selected line will be drop on the command input-box
